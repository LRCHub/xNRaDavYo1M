It's all the same
only the names will change
Every day it seems
we're wasting away
Another place where
the faces are so cold
I'd drive all night
just to get back home
I'm a cowboy
on a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted dead or alive
I'm a cowboy
Wanted dead or alive
Sometimes I sleep
sometimes it's not for days
And the people I meet
always go their separate ways
you can have the day
by the bottle that you drink
And times when you're alone
all you do is think
I'm a cowboy
on a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted dead or alive
I'm a cowboy
Wanted dead or alive
<♪>
I walk these streets
this six string in my hand
still play for keeps
seem of me seem of back
I been everywhere
still I'm standing tall
I've seen a million faces
I'm a cowboy
on a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted dead or alive
I'm a cowboy
I'm wanted dead or alive
I'm a cowboy
Wanted dead or alive
